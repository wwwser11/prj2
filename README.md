## Project Structure

- **libs/**: Contains helper libraries and additional functions.
  - [`my_first_lib.py`](libs/my_first_lib.py): The first library file with utility functions.
  - [`second_train.py`](libs/second_train.py): Another library file for supplementary tasks.

- **python-array-algorithms/**: Directory for tasks focused on array and matrix manipulations.
  - [`easypasswords.txt`](python-array-algorithms/easypasswords.txt): Sample text file for password-related tasks.

- **Root directory files**: Various standalone Python scripts, each focusing on a different aspect of programming.

## Tasks and Exercises

1. **[Equation Solver](equation1.py)**  
   A basic equation solver for the linear equation `y = kx + b`.

2. **[OOP Game](game#2.py)**  
   A modified game script that introduces object-oriented programming concepts by using classes.

3. **[Class Exercises](idk.py)**  
   Additional practice script for working with classes.

4. **[Matrix Creation](make_mtrx.py)**  
   Creates and manipulates matrices, demonstrating foundational skills in array manipulation.

5. **[Password Access](password_access.py)**  
   A basic script to handle and verify password access using text file data.

6. **[Rectangle Geometry](perimeter_area_founder.py)**  
   Calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle, serving as a practical exercise for class usage in solving geometry problems.
