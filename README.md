## Equations and Calculations

- **File:** `equation1.py`
- **Description:** A basic equation solver for the linear equation `y = kx + b`.

---

## Text Alignment

- **File:** `test_task1.py`
- **Description:** Aligns words to the right side of the output. Useful for practicing text manipulation and formatting.

---

## List Operations

- **File:** `test_task2.py`
- **Description:** Takes two lists and removes overlapping characters from the first list. This task focuses on list operations and basic set theory concepts.

---

## User Input Formatting

- **File:** `test_task3.py`
- **Description:** Prompts the user to enter their name, age, and city, then displays this information in a neatly formatted style.

---

## File Handling Practice

- **File:** `test_task4.py`
- **Description:** A set of exercises focused on reading from and writing to files. Specific conditions and instructions are commented within the script.

---

## Simple Game

- **File:** `test_task5.py`
- **Description:** A basic game designed to improve coding logic. Task requirements and game instructions are detailed within the script.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Game

- **File:** `game#2.py`
- **Description:** A modified version of `test_task5`, incorporating classes for an introduction to object-oriented programming concepts.

---

## Class Exercises

- **File:** `idk.py`
- **Description:** Additional practice with classes. Instructions are commented within the script for easy reference.

---

## Rectangle Geometry

- **File:** `perimeter_area_founder.py`
- **Description:** Calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle. This task serves as practice for using classes to solve geometric problems.

---

## Additional Notes

- All tasks are designed to improve specific programming skills.
- Detailed instructions for each exercise can be found within the scripts.
